# Camera

This is a camera app based on Camera api (older api).
This was a project at training and I developed it for custom resolutions in camera .
And for better color reproduction in images.
It uses color matrix for increased saturation and contrast in images.
I known I should use render script because of its performance but I didn't know how to use that.
